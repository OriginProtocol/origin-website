Redemption can happen at any point in the future. Again, because NFTs are exchangeable, collectors could invest in luxury items with the hopes of these items appreciating in value.

Gallerists and artists have always cared deeply about presentation and curation as it can have a strong impact on the price of their assets.

msgid "The most obvious success metric for OUSD is its total circulating supply. As demand for OUSD grows, more OUSD will be minted and added to the total supply. DeFi protocols are often valued at a glance by the total dollar amount of value deposited into its smart contracts, or Total Value Locked (TVL). In order for OUSD to become successful, we must convince users to buy or mint OUSD, adding to its supply, and we must keep this OUSD held in user wallets or circulating instead of sold or redeemed for underlying stablecoins. Ease of access and network effects are two important factors in this. Direct incentives beyond industry leading APYs may also be a tool we implement in the future."
msgstr ""

#: templates/litepaper/platform.html:90
msgid "To achieve greater circulating supply, it is imperative that we make OUSD available on every major DeFi platform, decentralized exchange, and centralized exchange. Increasing OUSD’s representation on decentralized platforms will solidify OUSD as a money lego and composable building block for DeFi. Having OUSD markets on popular centralized exchanges allows us to onboard the millions of crypto users who are not familiar with Web 3 wallets like MetaMask but who do have exchange accounts. Although there are some unique challenges to integrating rebasing tokens on these platforms, these challenges are not difficult to overcome and rebasing tokens are growing in popularity."

In China, cryptocurrency’s largest market by trading volume, Wechat and Alipay have near monopolistic holds on consumers and merchants. These simple, centralized payment apps are used by customers paying merchants and by friends and family transferring money to each other. Furthermore, in many markets, the US and Europe especially, bank cards are still the go-to way to spend money for online and offline transactions.

Today, Venmo users shuffle money between their Venmo accounts and their checking accounts and credit cards. In the case of the former, money sitting in Venmo or checking accounts doesn’t earn any interest. Venmo balances that are funded by credit cards are even worse as there are fees charged by multiple intermediaries. In the later case, interest earned by users is usually negligible, especially when taking into account inflation. Cash back or rewards programs can offer users incentives but high interest rates for missing payments are a strong disincentive to users."

Payment apps are by nature already viral, with users onboarding their friends and family in order to transact with them, establishing powerful network effects. Merchants quickly adopt the payment services that attract the most users. By adding in the ability to earn yield the very instant that any new referred user accepts funds from a referring user, we believe the viral coefficient for existing users referring new users will be multiples higher than ever seen before in a traditional payments application."

Merchants will receive USD and need not know that OUSD was used as the underlying original currency to power the transaction. Again, when users’ OUSD is not being spent, it will automatically accumulate staggering yields that should be superior to any cash bank or credit card rewards program in existence."

For example, you could lock 100 OUSD in the Solana bridge in order to generate 100 sOUSD which would be freely transferable within the Solana ecosystem. The original OUSD would stay locked in a smart contract where it would continue earning yield. Inside Solana, the circulating sOUSD tokens would rebase in lockstep with the OUSD that was locked in the smart contract. Anyone who wishes to exit would be able to redeem their sOUSD for the originally locked capital plus any yield that was generated while they were holding it."

msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:133
msgid "Of paramount importance is the ability to cut out almost all of the transaction fees associated from bookings between buyers and suppliers. Because of the Fat Protocol phenomenon, the value of the network lies mostly in the value of the protocol layer<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote17'>17</a>, and less on the applications layer (in this case, websites that would otherwise charge fees). Our incentives are to build a rich ecosystem of buyers and sellers, so we do not intend to charge onerous transaction fees on the protocol level."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:137
msgid "Note that this does not necessarily prohibit transaction fees charged by third-party application developers. Today, Origin Tokens are used as an incentive mechanism that provides third-party marketplace operators with a revenue stream via Origin Commissions. Sellers can choose to promote their listings, providing an optional commission to the marketplace operator that helps connect them with a buyer. While we expect these fees to be significantly lower than existing centralized incumbents, it’s important that marketplace operators and e-commerce merchants have an incentive to build feature-rich dedicated experiences on top of the Origin developer libraries and protocols. "

msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:145
msgid "Today, if you wanted to start a traditional company to compete in the global economy, you would have to set up banking arrangements one country at a time and deal with all the related financial regulations. This creates a non-trivial barrier to entry for most startups looking to expand internationally. In fact, we often see regional clones who are able to launch faster in specific regions than the company that came up with the original idea. However, cryptocurrency is a global phenomenon. Thanks to the widespread availability of the Internet, the Origin platform and flagship marketplace app were immediately available in nearly every country in the world when we launched on the Ethereum mainnet. We view this as a significant advantage."

msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:23
msgid "First, as a collection, these companies have created tremendous impact to the world. Consumers of marketplaces have been able to improve their lives with access to products and services that were not available previously. Suppliers have used these platforms to reach customers at greater scale and ease than before. Each marketplace creates a “home” for buyer and supplier to come together and transact, creating liquidity for that market."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:24
msgid "Second, most sharing economy businesses follow the same growth lifecycle. Save for a few exceptions, these marketplaces are notoriously difficult to start and grow. Marketplace businesses oftentimes require millions of dollars to just get off the ground and, in the case of Uber and Airbnb, billions to scale. It’s the norm for these businesses to run at a deep loss in the early days. In effect, the corporation is subsidizing the usage of the marketplace for the participants. However, because of highly positive cross-side network effects<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote2'>2</a>, successful marketplace businesses are able to grow revenue exponentially over time, usually by charging a service fee for every transaction that happens on network. Network effect businesses, like sharing economy marketplaces, are usually winner-takes-all businesses<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote3'>3</a> and at mature stages extract a disproportionate amount of value from the network forthe managing corporations and their shareholders. In many ways, they begin looking like monopolies once they reach scale."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:28
msgid "Finally, while there are very significant differences in user experience, business mechanics, and vertical-specific features among Internet marketplace companies, they all share many pieces that have been built and rebuilt many times. Lyft, Postmates, and DoorDash have each individually engineered their own solutions to user and supplier profiles, purchase experiences, matching algorithms, and reviews and ratings. This is valuable proprietary technology on the one hand. On the other, it is a wasteful use of time and effort to reinvent the wheel each time to create a new marketplace vertical. Consumers are also left creating and managing dozens of accounts on these marketplace companies, each of which owns their personal data and transaction history."

Sure, they benefited by making revenue on the platform, but they are not getting outsized rewards for their integral contributions in the early days of the marketplace like employees and investors are.
