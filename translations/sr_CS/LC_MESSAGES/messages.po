msgid "To recap, at a high-level, the Origin Platform and third-party applications built on top of it have several intended advantages when compared to existing sharing economy marketplaces."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:133
msgid "Of paramount importance is the ability to cut out almost all of the transaction fees associated from bookings between buyers and suppliers. Because of the Fat Protocol phenomenon, the value of the network lies mostly in the value of the protocol layer<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote17'>17</a>, and less on the applications layer (in this case, websites that would otherwise charge fees). Our incentives are to build a rich ecosystem of buyers and sellers, so we do not intend to charge onerous transaction fees on the protocol level."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:137
msgid "Note that this does not necessarily prohibit transaction fees charged by third-party application developers. Today, Origin Tokens are used as an incentive mechanism that provides third-party marketplace operators with a revenue stream via Origin Commissions. Sellers can choose to promote their listings, providing an optional commission to the marketplace operator that helps connect them with a buyer. While we expect these fees to be significantly lower than existing centralized incumbents, it’s important that marketplace operators and e-commerce merchants have an incentive to build feature-rich dedicated experiences on top of the Origin developer libraries and protocols. "
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:141
msgid "We turn again to examples of highly verticalized sites (e.g. dog sitting) and regional players (e.g. bikesharing in Boulder, CO) as potential use cases that would benefit from a more specialized experience than what the default Origin flagship marketplace app or decentralized e-commerce store creator currently offer."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:145
msgid "Today, if you wanted to start a traditional company to compete in the global economy, you would have to set up banking arrangements one country at a time and deal with all the related financial regulations. This creates a non-trivial barrier to entry for most startups looking to expand internationally. In fact, we often see regional clones who are able to launch faster in specific regions than the company that came up with the original idea. However, cryptocurrency is a global phenomenon. Thanks to the widespread availability of the Internet, the Origin platform and flagship marketplace app were immediately available in nearly every country in the world when we launched on the Ethereum mainnet. We view this as a significant advantage."
msgstr ""

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:149
msgid "Other high-level benefits include having a built-in mechanism to incentivize early ecosystem participants who hold and use Origin Tokens (OGN). We are constantly thinking about the right incentives that will encourage ecosystem participants like developers, individual buyers and sellers, and others to use and promote the Platform. We intend to reward behavior that encourages new referrals to the Platform and builds marketing, operational, and trust/safety infrastructure for the Platform. You can see these economic incentives in action with our initial implementation of Origin Rewards."

Multiple home-sharing applications are now incentivized to feature her apartment so that they can compete for the OGN commissions.

msgid "Second, most sharing economy businesses follow the same growth lifecycle. Save for a few exceptions, these marketplaces are notoriously difficult to start and grow. Marketplace businesses oftentimes require millions of dollars to just get off the ground and, in the case of Uber and Airbnb, billions to scale. It’s the norm for these businesses to run at a deep loss in the early days. In effect, the corporation is subsidizing the usage of the marketplace for the participants. However, because of highly positive cross-side network effects<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote2'>2</a>, successful marketplace businesses are able to grow revenue exponentially over time, usually by charging a service fee for every transaction that happens on network. Network effect businesses, like sharing economy marketplaces, are usually winner-takes-all businesses<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote3'>3</a> and at mature stages extract a disproportionate amount of value from the network forthe managing corporations and their shareholders. In many ways, they begin looking like monopolies once they reach scale."

Lyft, Postmates, and DoorDash have each individually engineered their own solutions to user and supplier profiles, purchase experiences, matching algorithms, and reviews and ratings. This is valuable proprietary technology on the one hand. On the other, it is a wasteful use of time and effort to reinvent the wheel each time to create a new marketplace vertical. Consumers are also left creating and managing dozens of accounts on these marketplace companies, each of which owns their personal data and transaction history."

Having more buyers and sellers means more capital to further grow the business. Having invaluable troves of data, marketing dollars, and brand recognition are all powerful moats that prevent competitors from entering the market, thereby stifling innovation. The most salient example is probably Craigslist, the first mainstream services and goods marketplace on the Internet, which has thrived for over 20 years despite having an outdated user experience, lacking a dependable and trustworthy reputation system, and even failing to provide a native way to pay for transactions safely and easily<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote6'>6</a>."

The new regulations are so restrictive that thousands of rental properties in San Francisco have now been banned from the platform.
