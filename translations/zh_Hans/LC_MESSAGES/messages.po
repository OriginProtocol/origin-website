Working jointly with Brave, Origin enabled Brave to accept payments in its native token, BAT, for merchandise for the very first time. As part of the engagement, Origin also helped Brave sell its first ever non-fungible token (NFT) collection, which sold out in minutes."

In addition, Brave continues to do brisk business through Dshop split between credit card payments and cryptocurrency payments."

Brave wanted to signal to their token holders that they were committed to decentralized tech while still being able to serve their tens of millions of users who may be unfamiliar with it. Their previous platform could only serve the latter group. Brave’s first NFT collection sale was a smash success and we look forward to continuing a long-term, mutually rewarding relationship with them.”"

This means instead of actively managing OUSD as a business or actively managing the funds in the OUSD vault, Origin maintains the OUSD smart contracts as developers in order to keep the protocol functional and avoid catastrophic losses or failures for users. Origin does not intend to make strategic decisions to allocate funds from the OUSD vault. Funds in the OUSD vault are automatically deployed to the largest and most common DeFi protocols including Compound, Aave, and Curve, as outlined above. OUSD is a decentralized protocol on the Ethereum  blockchain without active management. Funds are allocated by OUSD smart contracts, not Origin employees, and Origin developers chose the aforementioned DeFi protocols for their safety and ubiquity in DeFi rather than to seek maximum yields or profits. The OUSD protocol is 100%% open-source and we are fast tracking OUSD to be governed in a totally decentralized fashion."

msgid "Mainstream cryptocurrency users now have the equivalent of a high-yield savings account automatically built into their Ethereum wallets whenever they are holding OUSD. This increases DeFi’s addressable user base from tens to hundreds of thousands of sophisticated users to tens of millions of users instantly. By comparison, Uniswap, the most widely used DeFi product to date has only interacted with approximately 250k Ethereum wallets since its inception."

msgid "Because OUSD makes it easy for consumers to switch between spending and savings mode, it can also become the ideal medium of exchange. Today, many merchants other than those dealing in black or grey markets do not have many incentives to accept cryptocurrencies. Because most consumers currently use credit cards and mobile payments, merchants are forced to accept payments predominantly with these methods. In the process, they are often charged a 2.90%% credit card processing fee, with other payment intermediaries (e.g. merchant bankers and interchange networks) also increasing the cost of doing business.

msgid "For merchants that have traditionally been skeptical of receiving cryptocurrency payments, being able to accept a yield-bearing stablecoin that beats traditional savings accounts and instantly earns yields at a minimum of 20%% APY is a powerful motivator. Instead of losing money on each sale, they are instantly adding capital to their merchant accounts that compounds instantly, giving them more operating capital over time. For merchants that oftentimes face cash flow management and inventory issues, being able to accept a yield-bearing form of payment is extremely compelling."

In China, cryptocurrency’s largest market by trading volume, Wechat and Alipay have near monopolistic holds on consumers and merchants. These simple, centralized payment apps are used by customers paying merchants and by friends and family transferring money to each other. Furthermore, in many markets, the US and Europe especially, bank cards are still the go-to way to spend money for online and offline transactions.

Today, Venmo users shuffle money between their Venmo accounts and their checking accounts and credit cards. In the case of the former, money sitting in Venmo or checking accounts doesn’t earn any interest. Venmo balances that are funded by credit cards are even worse as there are fees charged by multiple intermediaries. In the later case, interest earned by users is usually negligible, especially when taking into account inflation. Cash back or rewards programs can offer users incentives but high interest rates for missing payments are a strong disincentive to users."

Payment apps are by nature already viral, with users onboarding their friends and family in order to transact with them, establishing powerful network effects. Merchants quickly adopt the payment services that attract the most users. By adding in the ability to earn yield the very instant that any new referred user accepts funds from a referring user, we believe the viral coefficient for existing users referring new users will be multiples higher than ever seen before in a traditional payments application."

Merchants will receive USD and need not know that OUSD was used as the underlying original currency to power the transaction.

Users will be able to eject from the managed wallet at any point in time to simply hold their OUSD in their own self-managed wallets within the same app. We imagine that more and more users will gradually migrate from managed wallets to self-hosted wallets over time as they become educated about the benefits of underlying protocol."

For example, you could lock 100 OUSD in the Solana bridge in order to generate 100 sOUSD which would be freely transferable within the Solana ecosystem. The original OUSD would stay locked in a smart contract where it would continue earning yield. Inside Solana, the circulating sOUSD tokens would rebase in lockstep with the OUSD that was locked in the smart contract. Anyone who wishes to exit would be able to redeem their sOUSD for the originally locked capital plus any yield that was generated while they were holding it."

She inputs that she is willing to pay a 20 OGN commission every single time her apartment is rented out for one evening. Multiple home-sharing applications are now incentivized to feature her apartment so that they can compete for the OGN commissions. When one application acts as the final point of sale for a booking by finding the seller a renter, the application developer is rewarded the 20 OGN that she has offered up as commission"
msgstr "举一个例子，我们假设一个纽约的房主想把她的公寓放在Origin上。她输入说，公寓每被出租一晚，她愿意支付20个OGN作为佣金。这样，多家共享住宅的应用都会受到鼓励鼓励并竞争OGN佣金。当一个应用作为最终为卖方找到一个租客时，应用的开发人员将获得那20个OGN奖励。"

Advertisers (sellers) only pay in OGN tokens when successful sales have occurred.

This creates a much more efficient attribution model than the one that traditional advertising offers. Origin Commissions aligns the interests of sellers, application creators, and other affiliates to promote listings to buyers across the Origin network."

However, these marketplaces have always been governed by centralized companies that maintain their individual monopolies on data, transaction and other service fees, and ultimately, user choice. With blockchain and other distributed technologies beginning to hit the mainstream, the world is poised for a new wave of decentralized commerce."

msgstr "大多数共享经济企业都有几个共同点。"

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:23
msgid "First, as a collection, these companies have created tremendous impact to the world. Consumers of marketplaces have been able to improve their lives with access to products and services that were not available previously. Suppliers have used these platforms to reach customers at greater scale and ease than before. Each marketplace creates a “home” for buyer and supplier to come together and transact, creating liquidity for that market."
msgstr "首先，这些公司集合起来对全世界产生了深远的影响。市场的消费者已经能够通过获得以前没有的产品和服务来改善他们的生活。供应商使用这些新平台接触客户时，无论是规模还是方便性都更胜从前。每个市场都为卖家和买家创造出一个“家”，允许他们聚到一起进行交易，为那个市场创造出流动性。"

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:24
msgid "Second, most sharing economy businesses follow the same growth lifecycle. Save for a few exceptions, these marketplaces are notoriously difficult to start and grow. Marketplace businesses oftentimes require millions of dollars to just get off the ground and, in the case of Uber and Airbnb, billions to scale. It’s the norm for these businesses to run at a deep loss in the early days. In effect, the corporation is subsidizing the usage of the marketplace for the participants. However, because of highly positive cross-side network effects<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote2'>2</a>, successful marketplace businesses are able to grow revenue exponentially over time, usually by charging a service fee for every transaction that happens on network. Network effect businesses, like sharing economy marketplaces, are usually winner-takes-all businesses<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote3'>3</a> and at mature stages extract a disproportionate amount of value from the network forthe managing corporations and their shareholders. In many ways, they begin looking like monopolies once they reach scale."
msgstr "其次，大多数共享经济企业遵循相同的增长周期。除了个别例外，这些市场非常难启动和发展。市场企业仅仅在起步阶段就往往需要数百万美元，以Uber和Airbnb为例，它们耗资数十亿美元才形成规模。这些企业在早期阶段的运营中出现巨额亏损，这是很普遍的情况。事实上，这些公司在为使用市场的参与者提供补贴。但是，由于强大的跨边网络效应<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote2'>2</a>,，成功的市场企业能够随着时间的推移让收入以指数级增长，而且通常是通过对网络上产生的每笔交易收取手续费。网络效应企业（如共享经济市场）通常是“赢家通吃”的企业<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote3'>3</a>，在成熟阶段为主管公司和股东从网络中攫取出搞得不成比例的价值。一旦达到一定的规模，他们从很多角度来看都很像垄断企业。"

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:28
msgid "Finally, while there are very significant differences in user experience, business mechanics, and vertical-specific features among Internet marketplace companies, they all share many pieces that have been built and rebuilt many times. Lyft, Postmates, and DoorDash have each individually engineered their own solutions to user and supplier profiles, purchase experiences, matching algorithms, and reviews and ratings. This is valuable proprietary technology on the one hand. On the other, it is a wasteful use of time and effort to reinvent the wheel each time to create a new marketplace vertical. Consumers are also left creating and managing dozens of accounts on these marketplace companies, each of which owns their personal data and transaction history."
msgstr "最后，尽管互联网市场公司之间的用户体验、商业机制和垂直化特性方面存在非常大的差异，但它们都有很多一而再、再而三打造出的共同点。Lyft、Postmates和DoorDash针对用户和供应商配置文件、购买体验、匹配算法以及评论和评分各自设计出了解决方案。一方面，这是极具价值的专有技术。另一方面，每次在构建新的垂直化市场时都把轮子重新发明一遍，这是对时间和精力的双重浪费。用户也需要创建和管理很多不同的账户，而且所有的公司都拥有和掌控着他们的个人数据和交易历史。"

#~ msgid "The most obvious success metric for OUSD is its total circulating supply. As demand for OUSD grows, more OUSD will be minted and added to the total supply. DeFi protocols are often valued at a glance by the total dollar amount of value deposited into its smart contracts, or Total Value Locked (TVL). In order for OUSD to become successful, we must convince users to buy or mint OUSD, adding to its supply, and we must keep this OUSD held in user wallets or circulating instead of sold or redeemed for underlying stablecoins. Ease of access and network effects are two important factors in this. Direct incentives beyond industry leading APYs may also be a tool we implement in the future."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "To achieve greater circulating supply, it is imperative that we make OUSD available on every major DeFi platform, decentralized exchange, and centralized exchange. Increasing OUSD’s representation on decentralized platforms will solidify OUSD as a money lego and composable building block for DeFi. Having OUSD markets on popular centralized exchanges allows us to onboard the millions of crypto users who are not familiar with Web 3 wallets like MetaMask but who do have exchange accounts. Although there are some unique challenges to integrating rebasing tokens on these platforms, these challenges are not difficult to overcome and rebasing tokens are growing in popularity."

On the centralized exchange side, we aim to have OUSD listed on every major exchange globally."

The converse is also true. OUSD holders are incentivized to be OGN holders, so they can participate actively in the governance of the protocol. This creates a strong flywheel effect between Origin’s two tokens."

#~ msgid "While we continue to see increased usage of Dshop, we are hyper focused on crypto-specific commerce verticals--most prominently non-fungible tokens (NFTs)--and are hard at work developing a fully-featured NFT platform."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "We believe NFTs are a nascent but highly disruptive technology that will bring our crypto-centric commerce products to millions, if not hundreds of millions, of users in the next few years. At the time of writing, Origin’s NFT Launchpad set an all-time record for gross sales in a single NFT drop at nearly $11.7M."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "In January of 2021, NFTs accounted for a record <a href='https://decrypt.co/56998/crypto-art-sales-on-ethereum-reach-a-record-80-million' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>$80M of transaction volume</a>. It is clear that NFT sales are growing at an exponential rate and represent the fastest growing opportunity for crypto-centric commerce."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "However, we believe that the majority of the market misconstrues NFTs as simply scarce digital art. At Origin, we believe NFTs are the crypto-centric building blocks that bridge fungible payment currencies like OUSD to multiple billion dollar opportunities."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "There is an enormous opportunity to use NFTs to power these creator communities. Because NFTs are freely exchangeable on the blockchain, they also inherently create an after-market for limited edition goods. "
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "The key to unlocking value in all of these crypto-centric opportunities with NFTs is making NFT issuance dead simple for creators. In addition, in contrast to existing players in the market like Nifty Gateway, we believe the creators should own the branding and have direct control over pricing models (e.g. different auction mechanics or tiered pricing). The Dshop NFT Launchpad gives creators and influencers more direct control over their content and their physical, digital, and experiential products. Just as many merchants have chosen Shopify over selling on generic marketplaces that do not allow for custom branding and direct relationships to end customers, we believe the same model will be successful for NFTs."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "All three aforementioned NFT-powered commerce opportunities are already supported by our platform. Almost $11.7M of gross sales were generated using Origin’s commerce platform in our inaugural campaign, a sum that smashed the previous record for a single NFT collection. Coverage of this record breaking event reached mainstream media outlets like the <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/nft-nba-top-shot-crypto.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>New York Times</a> and <a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2021/03/03/3lau-nft-nonfungible-tokens-justin-blau/?sh=17043b94643b' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Forbes</a>."

#~ msgid "Secondary market sales are vital for true price discovery of NFTs and the maturation of this nascent market. We intend to build a marketplace platform for secondary market sales of all NFTs launched on the [Origin NFT Auction Platform] as well NFTs from other platforms and marketplaces. The Origin team already has over 4 years of experience building peer-to-peer marketplace technology and we are the leaders in this field. The Origin Marketplace protocol was launched on Ethereum mainnet in 2018 and supported tens of thousands of users and listings for a variety of goods and services. Origin fully intends on being the NFT marketplace leader and capturing NFT sales from our partner creators as well as creators who launch independently or with another platform."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "NFTs being based on a common set of decentralized technology standards makes building a marketplace that can serve the entire NFT ecosystem possible. Any moats deployed by other NFT marketplace operators will be quickly rendered ineffective as they are against the spirit of decentralization. Another important aspect to our platform is that these secondary marketplaces can be run and curated by the NFT creators themselves. Gallerists and artists have always cared deeply about presentation and curation as it can have a strong impact on the price of their assets. Letting creators control every aspect of their NFT from creation to secondary market sale is a key differentiator to Origin’s NFT platform over more generic NFT marketplaces. Fans of specific creators and artists will also appreciate going direct to the source instead of browsing through unrelated listings on a generalized marketplace."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Another reason creators should be excited about custom NFT marketplaces is that it allows them to better monetize their creations over a longer period of time. Artists will experience increased value capture from programmatic transaction fees attached to NFTs they create. This means that any secondary market sales will generate revenue for NFT creators in perpetuity. Previously, musical artists would only capture a small portion of this value through royalties and fine artists would capture no value from secondary sales."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Not only are secondary market sales important for price discovery, transaction fees from these sales will be one of the key revenue drivers for the [Origin NFT product] in the future. Far more volume is done on the secondary market than during initial sales and we expect record-breaking trades in the future. Origin intends to build a fully-featured NFT platform and ecosystem. We will develop the best end-to-end NFT platform in the space and capture massive value for our users, NFT creator partners, and our token holders."
